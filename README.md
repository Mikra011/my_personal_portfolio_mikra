### Usage Guidelines (I kept it here for reference)
Primary Color: Use this color prominently in both themes for headers, main navigation, and key calls to action to ensure they stand out and capture attention.

Secondary Color: Apply this color to secondary actions, links, and less prominent elements. It should complement the primary color and maintain visual balance.

Accent Color: Reserve this color for elements that need to draw attention, such as notifications, badges, or special features. It provides emphasis and highlights important content.

Background Color: Use this color for the primary background in both themes. Ensure there is enough contrast between the background and text colors to maintain readability.

Text Color: This color should be used for all body text to ensure legibility. Adjust text color according to the theme to maintain contrast and readability.



## Typography:

In this project, I use a combination of fonts to create a visually appealing and functional design. Here’s a breakdown of the fonts and their uses:

### Main Fonts:

-   #### Playfair Display for Headings

    Playfair Display is used for headings to provide an elegant and classic look. Its high contrast and refined style make it ideal for main titles and section headings.

-   #### Kurale for Body Text

    Kurale is chosen for body text due to its readability and graceful appearance. This serif font ensures that longer passages of text are easy to read while maintaining a sophisticated look.

-   #### Alfa Slab One for Highlights

    Alfa Slab One is used for highlighting key pieces of information. Its bold and striking presence effectively draws attention to specific words, phrases, or sections, enhancing the emphasis within the content.

### Animated/Decorative Fonts
For adding decorative and animated text elements, I use the following fonts:

-   #### Dancing Script
    Dancing Script is a lively and flowing cursive font perfect for adding a touch of whimsy and personal flair to your designs. It’s ideal for quotes, taglines, or any text that benefits from a dynamic, hand-written appearance.

-   #### Alex Brush
    Alex Brush complements Dancing Script with its elegant and refined brush-stroke style. This font is suitable for decorative headers, invitations, or any text that requires a sophisticated and stylish touch.
